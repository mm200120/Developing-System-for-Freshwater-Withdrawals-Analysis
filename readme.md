#  **AI-Powered Water Crisis Prediction System**
MAATLA OOKEDITSE MOSIMANYANE

## **Project Overview**

This is an **Artificial Intelligence system** that analyzes global freshwater data to predict which countries will face water crises. It transforms raw World Bank data into intelligent insights using **machine learning, clustering, and anomaly detection**.

## **What This AI System Does**

### **1. Predicts Water Crises Before They Happen**
- Uses **Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms** to forecast which countries will face severe water stress
- Calculates **crisis probability scores** (0-1) for each country
- Identifies **high-risk regions** 5-10 years in advance

### **2. Groups Countries by Water Usage Patterns**
- Applies **K-means clustering** to find countries with similar water behavior
- Reveals hidden patterns in how different regions manage water
- Creates 5 distinct clusters (e.g., "Extreme Stress," "Sustainable Use," "Rapid Growth")

### **3. Detects Unusual Water Usage Changes**
- Uses **Isolation Forest algorithm** to spot anomalies
- Flags countries with sudden, unexpected changes in water withdrawal
- Helps identify emerging water management issues

### **4. Recommends Smart Conservation Strategies**
- Suggests **data-driven solutions** based on what worked in similar countries
- Provides **personalized recommendations** for each country
- Leverages successful strategies from comparable situations

## **Key Features**

- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts future water stress levels
- **Pattern Recognition**: Groups 200+ countries by water usage behavior  
- **Early Warning System**: Alerts about potential crises
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests proven conservation strategies
- **Global Risk Map**: Visualizes water stress worldwide
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracks water usage trends since 1960

## **How It Works**

1. **Loads** World Bank freshwater withdrawal data (1960-2024)
2. **Engineers** 20+ intelligent features for AI models
3. **Trains** machine learning models on historical patterns
4. **Clusters** countries to find similar water usage profiles
5. **Detects** unusual patterns that might indicate problems
6. **Generates** actionable insights and recommendations

## **Who This Is For**

- **Environmental Researchers**: Analyze water stress trends
- **Policy Makers**: Make data-driven water management decisions
- **Data Scientists**: Study AI applications in environmental science
- **Students**: Learn about AI for sustainability
- **NGOs**: Identify regions needing water conservation assistance

## **Why This Matters**

Water scarcity affects **2 billion people** worldwide. This AI system helps:
- **Prevent** water crises through early prediction
- **Optimize** water management strategies
- **Share** successful conservation approaches
- **Monitor** global water sustainability goals

## **Technology Stack**

- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: plotly, matplotlib
- **Analytics**: statistical modeling, time series analysis
- **Interface**: Jupyter Notebook, interactive dashboards

## **Impact Potential**

This AI system transforms **complex environmental data** into **actionable intelligence**, helping humanity better manage one of our most precious resources: **fresh water**.
